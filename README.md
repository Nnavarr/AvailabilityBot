# AvailabilityBot :robot:

Welcome to the AvailabilityBot repository! This was created in an attempt to secure a 3080 graphics card for a friend :shopping_cart:. The card is curretly in high demand and websites have listed days of availability. The objective is to send a text message :iphone: alert as soon as it becomes available. 

If all goes well, my friend will have his dream PC build finalized shortly! :tada::video_game:

Special thanks to Eon (the bot) for the assistance!
